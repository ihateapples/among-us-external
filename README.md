# among-us-external
uses pymem to read the memory in Among Us.exe, then displaying those results onto a cool gui with a minecraft font.

instructions: 

run build.bat, after that's done then you can find your output executable file in the dist folder

OR you can run it from source but find the requirements yourself i was a bit too lazy to make a requirements.txt

Currently to do list:

add epic games support (i had to switch from steam because i got banned for sexual misconduct)
